// let keyword

/*
**** Cannot access a let variable before declaring it
*/
// console.log(user)
// let user;  // this gives an error since you can't access before declaring it

// you can declare an unassigned variable with let 
// let user;
// console.log(user);

// you can't redeclare a variable with let once it has been declared
// let user = "Ann";

// But we can re-assign the variable
// user = "Mary";
// console.log(user);
