// Using the spread operator, it's easy to concatenate arrays:
const fruits = ["apple", "pear", "plum"];
const berries = ["blueberry", "strawberry"];
const fruitsAndBerries = [...fruits, ...berries]; // concatenate
console.log(fruitsAndBerries); // outputs a single array

// It's also easy to join objects:

/*const flying = { wings: 2 }
const car = { wheels: 4 }
const flyingCar = {...flying, ...car}
console.log(flyingCar) // {wings: 2, wheels: 4}

Add new members to arrays without using the push() method
Here's how to use the spread operator to easily add one or more members to an existing array

/*
Convert a string to an array using the spread operator
Given a string, it's easy to spread it out into separate array items:
*/
const greeting = "Hello";
const arrayOfChars = [...greeting];
console.log(arrayOfChars); // Â ['H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']

/*
Copy either an object or an array into a separate one
Here's how to copy an object into a completely separate object, using the spread operator.
*/
const car1 = {
  speed: 200,
  color: "yellow"
};
const car2 = { ...car1 };

car1.speed = 201;

console.log(car1.speed, car2.speed);

// You can copy an array into a completely separate array, also using the spread operator, like this:

const fruits1 = ["apples", "pears"];
const fruits2 = [...fruits];
fruits1.pop();
console.log(fruits1, "not", fruits2);

/*
Note that the spread operator only performs a shallow copy of the source array or object. For more information on this, please refer to the additional reading.

There are many more tricks that you can perform with the spread operator. Some of them are really handy when you start working with a library such as React.
